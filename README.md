# Account_invoice_total for OpenERP 6.1

Until OpenERP 6.0.3 when creating a supplier invoice one first had to enter the grand total, this had to match with the computed total before the invoice could be verified.

In OpenERP 6.1 this feature has silently been removed. This module brings back the field and the extra verification check.
